# Power BI Project: Game Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project is a hands-on exploration of Power BI conducted by Soichiro Tanabe, focusing on data visualization techniques. The original analysis was conducted using Tableau ([Tableau Practice - Game Sales](https://github.com/soichi-berson/Tableau_practice_game_sales)), and this project replicates the analysis using Power BI. The analysis utilizes the 'Video Game Sales' dataset from Kaggle ([Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/)) and references design principles from YouTube ([Link 1](https://youtu.be/_xs8XXlGQVM?si=8VRXpreskPJhuUaE), [Link 2](https://youtu.be/v6fP8gyCLLc?si=5QlxT8vqSoK31wnZ)).
